        <h1>What's Speleology?</h1>

            <p>Speleology is the study of caves, from mapping and recording passages to understanding their formation and even unique biology. Underground explorations can range from a few hours to months, and require a great deal of preparation.</p>

        <h2>Why go underground?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>It's the last terrestrial frontier that we have to explore in-person! Due to their hostile environments, it is nearly impossible to access caves remotely.</li>
                <li>Caves often host endangered, rare, or unique species of animals, especially in the United States.</li>
                <li>Advancements in technology in caving often can be applied to a host of different fields, as expeditions often must prepare for long-term isolated survival, underwater diving, and living in total darkness.</li>
                <li>It's fun (if you like being in small spaces) and great exercise. More importantly, the community is very tight-knit and excited to have new members.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>How do I get involved?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The <a href="https://caves.org/">National Speleological Society</a> has clubs called "grottos" nationwide who host community events and make caving accessible.</li>
            <li>Because there are risks associated with caving that are not common in other outdoor sports and it is difficult to self-rescue, access to caves and systems is often limited. Groups and clubs are often the best, if not only, way to gain access.</li>
        </ul>
