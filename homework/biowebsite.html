        <p>I have been able to develop a range of multimedia production skills during my time at UMass Amherst alongside a writing portfolio covering a number of different professional styles.</p>
        <p>I also have experience in social media management, having run a social media page with several thousand followers in high school as a personal interest project. </p>
        <p>I have been a crew coach for three years now, and I am returning for my fourth running the boathouse at Camp Mowglis this year. Working at Mowglis has given me a wealth of practical experience in managing people and programs, and especially the ability to collaborate well even under pressure.</p>
        <p>I am currently a full-time student and a line cook at Chipotle looking for internship opportunities!</p>
